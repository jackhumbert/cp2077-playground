#### Usage

The lib can be used in two ways: as a shared or internal lib. 

##### Shared Lib

You can add the lib as a dependency.

##### Internal Lib

You can include a full or partial copy of the lib with only features you need in your mod. 

To prevent conflicts with other mods and / or shared lib, you must give your copy a unique namespace.
For example, you can simply use your mod's namespace or prepend with it: `BaseLib` â†’ `MyMod.BaseLib`. 

### Ink Playground

Mod to help understand how to build a UI from code. 
This entire widget is 100% built from scratch using redscript.
There are no repurposed original UI controllers.

To open the Ink Playground popup you have to hold `R` when on foot (same key as for reload or radio). 
To close the popup press `ESC` or `C` key.
