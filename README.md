### Native Lib

The lib exposes the native things that are not accessible in redscript by default.

### Base Lib

Prototype of the lib for redscript.

### Ink Playground

Mod to help understand how to build a UI from code. 
This entire widget is 100% built from scratch using redscript.
There are no reused, wrapped or extended original UI controllers (except `ButtonHints` helper).

To open the Ink Playground popup you have to hold `R` when on foot (same key as for reload or radio). 
To close the popup press `ESC` or `C` key.
